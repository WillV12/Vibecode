- What did you build?
    - I built a basic lunar lander game, inspired by this game that I played a few years ago: http://moonlander.seb.ly/
    - It has basic flight controls and physics, procedural terrain generation, and a basic points system
    - Serves a good proof of concept for something I'll do more properly in the future
      
- What language(s) or tools did you use?
    - I used JS and HTML as my programming languages
    - p5.js was used to make the sprites for the game
    - ChatGPT was used to quicken the process
      
- Which AI tools did you use, and how?
    - I used ChatGpt for this assignment. Specifically, it was used to make certain aspects of the game I knew I would be too slow to do.
      Things such as making the graphics, collision detection for those sprites, and some overhauls I wanted to do when I was running out of time
      
What did you do versus what AI helped with
   - I mainly did the terrain generation and the tuning that followed. I also did the controls for the lander, along with the countdown at the beginning.
     The final thing I worked on, but didn't really get to finish was the scoring. It works okay, but some of the scoring is unbalanced and doesn't work.
   - AI was used to draw the graphics, detect collsions, styling, and was used to quickly add the asteroid objects that fall out of the sky to hinder the player
     
- What’s one thing you’re proud of?
    - I really like the way the physics feel. I find it quite fun to play and mess around with. Definetly makes me want to do this game properly in the future
    
- What’s one thing you’d improve with more time?
    - Pretty much everything. I would like to go back on my own and do this for real. Make better terrain generation that doesn't need flat spots to be added.
      The terrain should be more cohesive and the landing spots smaller. Also, I would improve the scoring, make certain aspects such as speed and tricks actually work 
      correctly and are a viable strategy to score points. Multipliers for landing at certain spots is in the original game, and something I totally forgot about until I got
      home today. Ideally, I could have done more with the time alloted, but I bounced around a few concepts before landing (See what I did there!) on this one, wasting
      about an hour. If I had to choose one thing to improve right here and now, it would be the terrain generation. I just want it to look better and be more engaging than
      trying to land at the same few spots.
